Project Explanation:

Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java

This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game created using Java. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, trying to get three of their marks in a row to win. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

Key Components:

Board Setup:

The game board is a 3x3 grid.
Each cell in the grid is represented by a button.
The grid is displayed in a window.

Player Turns:

Players alternate turns, with 'X' going first.
When a player clicks a button, their mark ('X' or 'O') is placed in that cell.

Winning and Drawing:

The game checks for a winner after each turn.
A player wins if they get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
The game checks for a draw if all cells are filled without a winner.
